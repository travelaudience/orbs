  Run `pytest` against the repo.
  Provides an option to upload coverage report to code climate.
  By default it requires `requirements-ci.txt` with test dependencies.
  By default it requires `requirements.txt` with code dependencies.
  If disabling `install_pytest` variable it requires both
  `pytest` and `pytest-cov` in file `requirements-ci.txt`.
parameters:
  source:
    default: src
    description: Define location for the code source to test
    type: string
  test_source:
    default: tests
    description: |
      Define location for the test source containing all the tests to execute
    type: string
  ci_requirements:
    description: |
      Enable the definition of a requirements file for tests in addition to the regular `requirements.txt`.
      This file must include both `pytest` and `pytest-cov`.
      If this file is empty the installation of test requirements is skipped and `pytest` and `pytest-cov` will be installed.
    type: string
    default: "requirements-ci.txt"
  install_pytest:
    description: |
      Install pip dependencies for this flow to run.
      Both  `pytest` and `pytest-cov` are required.
    type: boolean
    default: false

      Enable the use of code-climate for test coverage analysis
      requires code-climate CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID env variable to be added to the job
      the best place for this is in the project in CircleCI UI
      the code-climate ID is specific to each repo
