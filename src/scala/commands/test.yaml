  Run `sbt test:test` against the repo. Provides an option to upload coverage report to code climate.
  If using coverage, it's advisable to add `scoverage` to plugins.sbt

parameters:
  project_base:
    description: Where test output gets placed
    type: string
    default: target
  with_coverage:
    description: |
      Enable the use of code-climate for aggreated test coverage analysis
        requires code-climate CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID env variable to be added to the job
        the best place for this is in the project in CircleCI UI
        the code-climate ID is specific to each repo
    type: boolean
    default: true

  memory_limit_for_heap:
    description: aggregating the test coverage requires more memory to be defined
    type: string
    default: 1524M
