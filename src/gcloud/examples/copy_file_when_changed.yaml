  To copy a file from the repo to the bucket, when the file changes.
  Advisable to add filters to the job, so that the copy only happens when change is merged to master (for example).

  WARNING: The `pipeline.git.base_revision` values is only from the last CircleCI build.
           If the previous build failed to update the file, and the current build didn't change the file again,
           the file won't be updated...
           If that is a risk, the set `only_file_change` to `false`.
